# Manoeuvring-of-Micro-Robots-using-External-Magnetic-Fields

In this dissertation, a local magnetic field generating system for microrobot actuation is designed and modelled. Robots ranging from 4-8mm diameter are controlled to move on the 2D
workspace. The field produced by the coils is experimentally validated and a new design of
robot is shown, where the bot can be manipulated even when it is not in direct contact with the
2D platform. A camera based position feedback system is designed to get the present location
of the bot, and this information is sent to the path planning algorithm, where it decides which
is the next best position for the bot to reach, and this information is sent to Arduino to actuate
those particular coils to reach the next position. Different kinds of movements are achieved
where the bot was moved from (a) centre of the coil to corner of the coil and (b) corner of the
coil to centre of the coil and the strategies employed to move the bot in that particular format
are discussed. Using local field control strategy, multiple robot control is achieved, where two
bots motion are controlled independently. Finally an attempt is made to re orient a part placed
on the 2D grid, with the help of a microrobot.
